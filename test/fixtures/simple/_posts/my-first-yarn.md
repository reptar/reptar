I used to collect string. Every day I'd find a piece and add it to my collection.

After a couple of years I had no room left. So I took out all the pieces of string and started weaving them together.

A few more years passed and I had myself a ball of yarn. I bring it with me, wherever I go. Me and my yarn.
